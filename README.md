# Project2-Front-End
This is a project that simulates the Front-End of a Book web page. 
You can add as many books to your "book list" as you want, and edit or delete them if you don't want them anymore. 
The information will not be deleted while using the same browser (even if you refresh or close it).
It has the media queries to function in devices of different sizes. 
This is my first project using ReactJS, TailwindCSS and LocalStorage :)
